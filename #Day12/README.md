# ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
Today i did a little practice to finish of post SOLID practices, i should be faster... Meh, life issues. This practice includes at least the most of the principles applied in a single excercise where i get some fun recreating Pokemon Pokedex, in this time, i create an Pokedex with some special functionalities but without break the essentials of SOLID. Hope you enjoy, see you with the next steps of the things i want to learn.

# â˜• What i've learned from this?
I practiced the application of the most of the SOLID principles together, with this, we got done the SOLID principles learning! :D
