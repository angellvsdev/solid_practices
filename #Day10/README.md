# ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
Today i was practicing the last concept of the *SOLID principles*, the *Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)*, this principle tells us that all is guided by an main
interface that connects all the modules (both high-level and low-level), this is really just a little part of the whole excercise, particularly, this principle is easy
to understand but not to apply for me as well, then i'll post this part while i solve the whole excercise to post the demonstration, by the moment, i did enjoy
coding this, even if it's just something stupid to complete, i think it's challenging and that's good, i can improve :D, see you tomorrow with the rest of this.

# ðŸ“‹ What i've learned from this?
The basic concept of the *Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)*.
