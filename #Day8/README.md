# ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
Today, to get in practice with the rest of the **SOLID principles**, now we'll touch the Liskov Substitution Principle, this principle tell us that all the subclasses
of a father class got to be capable of replace his father, according to this conditions too:

- If you override a method of the superclass in the subclass, these methodâ€™s parameters should match with the superclassâ€™ method or should be more abstract.
- If you override a method of the superclass in the subclass, this method should return the same type with the superclassâ€™s method or should be subclass of the superclass methodâ€™s return type.
- If you override a method of the superclass in the subclass, the method in a subclass shouldnâ€™t throw types of exceptions which the base method isnâ€™t expected to throw.
- If you override a method of the superclass in the subclass, this method shouldnâ€™t strengthen pre-conditions of superclassâ€™ method.
- If you override a method of the superclass in the subclass, this method shouldnâ€™t weaken post-conditions of the superclassâ€™ method.
- A subclass shouldnâ€™t change the values of the private fields of the superclass.

# ðŸ“‹ What i've learned from this?
I've learned how to apply the Liskov Substitution Principle in a begginer level, now with this i'm closer to apply the five principles in only one programm or application for this challenge.
