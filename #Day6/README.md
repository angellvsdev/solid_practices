# ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
Hello, world! Now i'm back in this challenge (after six months, i know, it's too much), i've decided to practice the five solid principles this week from zero, then we'll be working with programming paradigms and complex use of the solid principles, in this case i practiced with the Single Responsibility Principle to be sure that i didn't forget it, all i did was imagine i had a eCommerce application with two functionalities, where one is create the marketplace products and the other is a cart where i would put multiple products.

# ðŸ“‹ What i've learned from this?
I remembered the Single Responsibility Principle use.
