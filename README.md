# ‚ñ∂ RESUMED
After 6 long months with so many events in my life, a graduation, and so many mucho, i've decided to commit myself again to accomplish this challenge until the year ends, i will do it, **and this challenge is resumed since 29/8/2022**.

# ‚å® My100DaysOfCode ‚òï
**Hello, world!**
I've decided to commit myself to complete the challenge of **#100DaysOfCode**, this means i'm gonna code at least 1 hour per day during 100 days, and i'm gonna approach this 3 months to masterize two key concepts in the programming world; [Programming Paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) and [Software Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), and i'm gonna use this repository as a journal to track my progress and remain ordered across this whole challenge.

## ‚ùî How will i achieve this?
I'll be learning from the resources and sources I've been gathering for a while and each day i will be trying new things with the learned concepts or practicing it to understand them correctly and learn. All this practices includes little projects to challenge myself, little excercises, speed coding rounds with friends and other stuffm and, at the end of the challenge, i've be dominated both programming paradigms and software design patterns (i hope). For this challenge, i'll be using JavaScript to code.

## üìã Rules:
- I should programm at least 1 hour each day.
- There is no strike system, but it is forbidden to lose two consecutive days without coding.
- The inverted time in all things related to programming got to be sitting down and coding, studies and other things like big projects planning does not count.

**Just as a little note; if you want to do this challenge too i'll leave you the official website of [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com)**

*Very sad how I write this as if many people will notice it. Does someone know that this GitHub exist at least? Probably just a kid in 2027 looking for resources to learn how to code and encountered this just by look... Hello kid.* ü¶â
