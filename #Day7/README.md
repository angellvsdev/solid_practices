# ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
As i said, i'm remembering the fundamentals of SOLID this week, now we go for the **O**, and this time, i did and excercise that i think illustrates better
how should be applied the Open/Closed principle, in this case, we still talking about our imaginary e-commerce, and now all we want to do is create inventory stocks.

# ðŸ“‹ What i've learned from this?
