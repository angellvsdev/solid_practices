# ðŸ“‹ What i did today?
Today i did practice the *Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)*, this principle tells us that the clients shouldn't depend of interfaces and functionalities they don't
use, i really like this principle because it's very easy to understand and apply, and basically all we got to do is slash our code in little interfaces that connects
between them according to his needs. This was very fast to code **(it even not took me more than 30 minutes)**, but in this occasion i've decided to did it simple, and 
along the challenge i'll practice more complex and useful things to improve myself to the 101%. âš¡ðŸ”¥

**NOTE: JavaScript doesn't posses Interfaces by itself, (that's why i'll be using TypeScript for this practices), so i had to use Mix-ins to simulate little interfaces.**

# ðŸ“‹ What i've learned from this?
The use of JavaScript Mix-ins and the basic application of the *Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)*.
